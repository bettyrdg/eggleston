          Eggleston was founded in 2017 by two friends in Chicago, IL that share a love for breakfast and an appreciate for famous photographer, William Eggleston. 
          <p>Eggleston is an all vegetarian breakfast restaurant and coffee shop located in northwest Chicago. We specialize in egg dishes and hand-crafted espresso beverages. We also bake fresh pastries every morning, rotating our menu every season with speciality items.</p>
          <p>We take much pride in offering a menu of organic, locally sourced dishes. Our eggs come from a free-range chicken farm located an hour from the city, and everything else from our produce, fruit, and espresso beans come from an organic farm that we have built a strong relationship with. Here at Eggleston we are passionate about creating a safe space and welcoming everyone to enjoy our signature Egg dishes and hand-crafted beverages.</p>
